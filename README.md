How to run:

Download the zip file and open the "index.html" file with you favorite browser

Each page has optimized to achieve a 90+ Google PageSpeed score. Javascript has also been optimized to achieve a 60+ FPS rendering speed. I have included two versions of each HTML page: a production version and a development version.

The production versions include minified CSS and Javascript. They are the .html files (e.g. index.html).
The development versions include no minification, so that you can more easily read through the code and understand what's happening. They are the _dev.html files (e.g. index_dev.html).
